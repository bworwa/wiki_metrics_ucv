v1.0.1
	- Fixed an issue related to Wikipedia's spanish dates formats.
	- Fixed an issue related to messages formats, having a message with %'s in it would break the log function.
	- Fixed an issue related to unquoted (unescaped) URLs, URL's paths containing unescaped special characters would break the system.
	- Added the message "X/X URLs have been added/removed to/from the URL pool" when adding/removing URLs.
	- Improved console messages.
	- Refactored the Daemon class.
	- Removed the -d -(start | stop) -a option, it was causing non-safe terminations.

	  started while daemons are running. If threads are started in console mode then the respective daemons are killed beforehand.
