v1.0.3
	- Improved the front-end.
	- Fixed the 'usernames' new line problem.
v1.0.2
	- Refactored the Daemon class.
	- Standardized the file management of the Daemon and Console class.
	- Changed daemons -start and -stop commands to start and stop, respectively.
	- Added extra messages to the console, allowed commands will only show if the user types "command -help" instead of showing them
	  by default on "command/option miss".
	- Added the -d -(start | stop) -a option removed in v1.0.1
	- The console no longer "auto-kills" the daemons when starting the threads, instead the user is asked to kill the daemons manually
v1.0.1
	- Fixed an issue related to Wikipedia's spanish dates formats.
	- Fixed an issue related to messages formats, having a message with %'s in it would break the log function.
	- Fixed an issue related to unquoted (unescaped) URLs, URL's paths containing unescaped special characters would break the system.
	- Added the message "X/X URLs have been added/removed to/from the URL pool" when adding/removing URLs.
	- Improved console messages.
	- Refactored the Daemon class.
	- Removed the -d -(start | stop) -a option, it was causing non-safe terminations.
	- Added extra logic to the daemons-console interaction, daemons cannot be started while a console is running but a console can be
	  started while daemons are running. If threads are started in console mode then the respective daemons are killed beforehand.
	- /tmp directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist.
	- Added SIGTERM, Ctrl + C and Ctrl + D handlers to the console and daemons (SIGTERM) in order to avoid data corruption.
